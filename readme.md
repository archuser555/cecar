# How To Run It?

**OK so you want to run OJG in your localhost machine, well, runing OJG in localhost aren't the same in all operation systems...**
### __Run OJG On Linux__
**First, be sure that you are in the directory where OJG source code are, and install mariadb or mysql, and also have php installed, then open mariadb/mysql with root, via __sudo mariadb__ or __sudo mysql__, after this, run __source ./database/db.sql__ in mariadb/mysql, exit via pressing CTRL+C, then run __sudo php -S 127.0.0.1:9996__ and access it via your favorite web browser, like firefox etc, if anything went wrong, then the probleme is maybe that you didnt use the root user in mysql/mariadb, or you change the 9996 port in php :D**
### __Run OJG On Mac Os__

**It's the same steps as Linux**

### __Run OJG On Microsoft Os__

**I have no idea, but it would be possible via XAMPP and linking the database with OJG by putting the database data on ./api/config.php, That's It :D**
